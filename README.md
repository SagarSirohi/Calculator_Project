# Calculator Project
A calculator is a machine which allows people to do math operations more easily. 
For example, most calculators will add, subtract, multiply, and divide. 
Some also do square roots, and more complex calculators can help with calculus and draw function graphs. Calculators are found everywhere.
A calculator is a small electronic device that makes mathematical calculations. 
It's used by students, financial advisors, accountants, and many others when mental math won't produce a fast, accurate answer.
Calculators are simply a tool students use to help solve problems. 
Since they eliminate tedious computations and algebraic manipulations that discourage many students, calculators allow more students to solve problems and appreciate the power and value of mathematics in the world today.
